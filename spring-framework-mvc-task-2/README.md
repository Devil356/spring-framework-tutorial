# Spring MVC - JSP task

This web application should allow you to **create a new user** using a form by URL `/users/add`. 
It should handle POST request with new user data by URL `/users`. It should also handles GET requests to URL `/users`
 and **show a list of existing users**.
 
 All views are already implemented via JSP.
 
 Your job is to 
 * configure `ViewResolver` for JSP views
 * implement `UserController` methods
