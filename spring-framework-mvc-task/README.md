# Spring MVC - Sum controller task

This is a web application that provides an endpoint to calculate a mathematical sum. Thus, you can **calculate a sum of a**,
 and b using the following URL `'/sum/a/b'`, and application should return you the result message.
 
 E.g. `http://localhost:8080/sum/12/98` should respond with the message `12 + 98 = 110`
 
 The described logic should be implemented in `SumController`, and you job is to 
 * **finish controller implementation**
  
  _All other required configurations are already implmented. To test this application, you need to deploy it to the Servlet
   container (e.g. Tomcat)_
